            "description"   => "<p>Drone-X Hybrid Drone technology applies in the Agriculture and Health
Sector. It is locally fabricated specifically for agricultural and health
monitoring to enable precision data collection and monitoring. The
drone is an improved model from the existing drones as it enables precise
monitoring of the soil and crop health, and enables timely detection of the
onset of diseases. Smallholder farmers will be able to access real-time data
about their fields to make informed decision regarding irrigation, pest and
disease control and fertiliser application. Early disease detection will allow
farmers to prevent postharvest losses for better livelihood.
BISO Smart Irrigation System focuses on the use of Hybrid Renewable
Energy Systems, Biogas and Solar to Power up an Irrigation System. It is
a BISO TECH system that has been developed and tested. It comprises
a mobile monitoring system and its interface. The petrol engine (Water
Pump) has been modified to be able to use biogas (combustion) and solar
(Direct Current). The technology will help smallholder famers in optimizing
water usage, enhance remote control and monitoring of fields and reduce
energy costs which will in return increase their productivity. Since use of
Petrol/Diesel powered water pumps is costly and not sustainable, the
government’s program on Mega Farms can also benefit from this renewable
energy technology.
“For us at Drone-X Technologies, being a member of the CAT AgriTech innovators
has been a rewarding experience. We have learned a lot throughout the program,
from entrepreneurship principles to the value of human-centred design in creating
solutions. The creation of Drone-X Technologies was significantly influenced by the CAT
innovation challenge, and the entrepreneurship education offered by CAT motivated us
to turn our project into a startup business. We were fortunate to meet the appropriate
people during the program, which helped us grow and advance. As we focused on
creating our novel solution, this improved our technical proficiency in data and drone
technologies.”</p>",

The Agri-tech Innovation Challenge aligns with Malawi’s economic diversification agenda, supporting the
government’s vision of agricultural productivity and commercialization. By developing economically viable,
data-driven decisions for smallholder farmers, the initiative aims to help them achieve greater economic
success. Moreover, it contributes to reducing the country’s heavy reliance on tobacco and provides alternatives
for smallholder farmers to move away from tobacco-dependent economies. The program’s focus on innovation
and entrepreneurship can lead to the creation of new economic drivers for agricultural diversification and
transformation, ultimately benefiting the agricultural sector and the country’s economy</p>",
